    "    * You might use ***mode*** to determine the most frequently purchased car in a state.\n",
    "* An entire group is called a **population**. \n",
    "* Sometimes a population is quite large, such as the people likely to vote in the next U.S. presidential election, which is a number in excess of 100,000,000 people. \n",
    "* For practical reasons, the polling organizations trying to predict who will become the next president work with carefully selected small subsets of the population known as **samples**. \n",
    "* Here we introduce **measures of dispersio**n (also called **measures of variability**) that help you understand how **spread out** the values are. \n",

    "variance**. \n",
    "* Squaring the difference between each die value and the mean of all die values emphasizes **outliers**—the values that are farthest from the mean—which can be important in data analysis.\n",
    "* In data analytics, sometimes we want to pay careful attention to outliers (a large transaction on a credit card) and sometimes we want to ignore them.\n",
